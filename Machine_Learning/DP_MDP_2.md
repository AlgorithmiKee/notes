Preliminary: Dynamic Programming for Markov Decision Process I

## Generalization

There are multiple ways to generalize the MDP:

* deterministic policy $\pi(s)\longrightarrow $ stochastic policy $\pi(a\mid s)$.
* deterministic rewards $r(s,a)\longrightarrow $ stochastic rewards $p(r\mid s,a)$.
* infinite time horizon and time invariance $\longrightarrow$ finite time horizon and time dependence.

In the following, we focus on generalization to stochastic policy and stochastic rewards.

### Stochastic Policy

Instead of mapping each state to a fixed action, a stochastic policy samples an action from the conditional distribution $\pi(\cdot\mid s)$.

$$
\begin{align}
A\sim\pi(a \mid s)
\end{align}
$$

Remarks:

* Stochastic policy satisfies the law of total probability.
  $$
  \begin{align}
  \sum_{a\in\mathcal A} \pi(a \mid s) &= 1, \:\forall s\in\mathcal S
  \text{ (for finite $\mathcal A$)}
  \\
  \int_{a\in\mathcal A} \pi(a \mid s) \,\mathrm da &= 1, \:\forall s\in\mathcal S
  \text{ (for continuous $\mathcal A$)}
  \end{align}
  $$

* A determinstic policy $s\mapsto a_s$ can be seen as a special of stochastic policy
  $$
  \begin{align}
  \pi(a \mid s) = \delta(a-a_s), \quad\forall a\in\mathcal A
  \end{align}
  $$
  where $\delta(\cdot)$ is Kronecker delta (for finite $\mathcal A$) or Dirac delta (for continuous $\mathcal A$).

* Under this setting, our stochastic policy is time-invariant (or ***stationary***). i.e. The distribution $\pi(\cdot\mid s)$ does not depend on when we arrived at $s$.

* If both $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal S$, we can represent a stochastic policy as a $\vert\mathcal S\vert\times\vert\mathcal A\vert$ matrix. Each entry $\pi(a\mid s)$ represents the proability of taking action $a$ at state $s$.

**Example**: An extremely simplifed model of stock trading. $\mathcal S$ denotes the market condition. $\mathcal A$ denotes your trading action.

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal S &= \{\text{bullish, bearish}\} \\
\mathcal A &= \{\text{buy, hold, sell}\}
\end{align*}
$$

A trading strategy inspired by the principle *"Be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful"* can be modelled as a stochastic policy:

| Market Condition | buy | hold | sell |
|------------------|-----|------|------|
| **bullish**      | 0.2 | 0.4  | 0.4  |
| **bearish**      | 0.6 | 0.3  | 0.1  |

#### Why stochastic policy?

If the agent has perfect knowledge of the environment (state transiton, rewards, etc.), then any deviation from the optimal policy (which is deterministic, as shown later) will indeed yield a lower total reward. In this case, a deterministic policy suffices. The agent only needs to compute the optimal policy -- this is called ***planning problem***. e.g. shortest path problem in a graph with known weights.

In contrast, a ***learning problem*** assumes that the agent does not have the perfect environment model. e.g. shortest path problem in a graph with unknown edge weights. The optimal policy derived from an imperfect environment model is unlikely to be optimal in real environment. In this case, stochastic policy allows the agent to explore the environment by occasionally try different actions, even at a risk of receiving a lower total reward.

#### Exploitation vs. Exploration

* ***Exploitation***: execute the optimal policy based on current understanding of the environment. It yields the highest total reward based on current understanding but misses the oppurtunity for a potentially higher total reward.

* ***Exploration***: deviate from the optimal policy by occasionally trying different actions. It may yield a lower or higher total reward compared to exploitation.

Real-life analogy: Suppose you're looking for good restaurants in your city. You've found that restaurant A is your favorite spot for lunch and restaurant B is your favorite for dinner. Exploitation means you always return to A for lunch and B for dinner â€” you're likely to be satisfied, but you miss the chance to discover new favorites. Exploration means occasionally trying a new place, say restaurant X. It might not be as good as A, or it could turn out to be even better.

In planning problems, only exploitation is necessary because the environment is fully known. In learning problems, however, it is crucial to balance exploitation and exploration.

### Stochastic Rewards

Given a state action pair $(s,a)$, instead of receving a deterministic reward, the agent receives a stochastic reward sampled from $p(\cdot\mid s,a)$.

$$
R\sim p(r\mid s,a)
$$

Moreover, we let $\mathcal R\subseteq\mathbb R$ denote the reward sets. Then, $p(r\mid s,a)$ is either a PMF (if $\mathcal R$ is finite) or a PDF (if $\mathcal R$ is continuous).

Remarks:

* Stochastic reward satisfies the law of total probability
  $$
  \begin{align}
  \sum_{r\in\mathcal R} p(r\mid s,a) &= 1, \:\forall (s,a)\in\mathcal S\times\mathcal A \\
  \text{or }
  \int_{r\in\mathcal R} p(r\mid s,a) \,\mathrm dr &= 1, \:\forall (s,a)\in\mathcal S\times\mathcal A \\
  \end{align}
  $$

* A determinstic reward $(s,a)\mapsto r_{sa}$ can be seen as a special of stochastic reward
  $$
  \begin{align}
  p(r\mid s,a) = \delta(r - r_{sa}), \quad\forall r\in\mathcal R
  \end{align}
  $$
  where $\delta(\cdot)$ is Kronecker delta (for finite $\mathcal R$) or Dirac delta (for continuous $\mathcal R$).

* The stochastic reward is again stationary. i.e. The distribution of the reward does not depend on when we arrive at $s$ or when we take action $a$.

## Markov Decision Process

A generalized Markov decision process (MDP) consists of

* $\mathcal S$: set of states.
* $\mathcal A$: set of actions.
* $\mathcal R$: set of rewards.
* $p(s'\mid s, a)$: state transition probability.
* $p(r \mid s, a)$: reward probability.
* $\gamma\in[0,1)$: discount factor.

The agent executes a stochastic policy $\pi$. Then, we are interested in

1. policy evaluation
2. computing optimal policy

Consider the execution of $\pi$ from a fixed initial state $s$.

$$
s \xrightarrow[R]{A \:} S' \xrightarrow[R']{A' \:} \cdots
$$

Key observation:

* The immediate reward $R$ is now stochastic: $R\sim p(r\mid s,\pi(s))$. The stochasticity of immediate reward comes from
  1. stoachsticity in action $A$ due to stochastic policy
  1. reward probability
* Starting from the next state, the stochasticity in $R'$ comes from
  1. stoachsticity in state $S'$ due to state transition proability
  1. stoachsticity in action $A'$ due to stochastic policy
  1. reward probability

The total (discounted) reward is defined exactly the same as in MDP I:

$$
\begin{align}
G_t
&= R_t + \gamma R_{t+1} + \gamma^2 R_{t+2} + \dots \\
&= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^k R_{t+k}
\end{align}
$$

Recursive structure:

$$
\begin{align}
G_t = R_t + \gamma G_{t+1}
\end{align}
$$

TODO: factor the probability disctribution
