# Math Challenge

## Functions and Sets

Let $\gamma\in(0,1)$ and $f:\mathcal X \to \mathbb R$ where $\mathcal X$ can be any set. Suppose
$$
f(x)\ge \gamma\min_{x'\in\mathcal X} f(x')
$$
Show that $f(x) \ge 0, \forall x\in\mathcal X$

## Probabilities

For a given $\gamma\in(0,1)$, a real random variable $X$ satisfies
$$
X \ge \gamma\mathbb E[X]
$$
Show that $X\ge 0$. (The inequalities are taken almost surely)
